## Overview of the Project

Any organization spanning beyond a city needs to supervise operations across its region for better performance and productivity. This project provides a real-time map and business intelligence dashboard to monitor Food Business Operators (FBOs) registered at the Punjab Food Authority (PFA). The goal is to improve performance, detect issues promptly, and minimize business losses.

## Details and Usage of the Map

**Map:**

- Shows currently active FBOs in Punjab, categorized by status with unique colors.
- Green: Active and non-expired licenses.
- Red: Active but expired licenses.
- Yellow: Verified but not inspected (no license).
- Black: Inspected but no license generated.
- Purple: Unverified applications.

**Usage:**

- Scroll the map to identify clusters of FBOs with the same colored dots.
- E.g., a cluster of yellow dots in a city suggests a lack of inspections or inspectors.

**Bar Chart:**

- Useful for analyzing specific districts.
- Click on a district to view its data on the map.
- Bars are categorized by status for specific insights.

**Data Summary Boxes:**

- Display FBO counts in each status category.
- Show delays related to status categories, e.g., average delay in verifying newly registered businesses (e.g., 85 days).
